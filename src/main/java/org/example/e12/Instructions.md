# Exercise 12: Calculate Total and Average Cost

## Objective
Learn how to perform basic arithmetic operations in Java and work with multiple variables.

## Instructions

**For you to do:**

1. **Declare Variables**
    - Declare four float variables: `item1`, `item2`, `item3`, and `item4`.
    - Assign prices to these variables. For example:
      ```java
      float item1 = 15.5f;
      float item2 = 23.0f;
      float item3 = 9.99f;
      float item4 = 27.49f;
      ```

2. **Perform Operations**
    - Add the prices of all items to calculate the total cost and store the result in a variable.
    - Calculate the average cost of the items using the formula:
      [
      averageCost = totalCost/4
      ]
      and store the result in a variable.

3. **Print Values**
    - Print the total cost and average cost in the following format:

4. **Run Your Program** to see the output.

## Expected Output
```
The total cost is 75.98
The average cost is 18.995
```

## Tips
- Remember to use `System.out.println` to print the results.
- Ensure your variables are declared and assigned correctly.

## Additional Information
- **Float Variables**: A float variable can hold decimal numbers.
- **Arithmetic Operations**: Use the `+` and `/` operators to perform addition and division respectively.

## Troubleshooting
- If your program doesn't compile, check for syntax errors such as missing semicolons or incorrect variable declarations.
- If the output is not as expected, ensure that the variables are assigned the correct values and printed correctly.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully complete the exercise and understand how to perform basic arithmetic operations in Java. Happy coding!
