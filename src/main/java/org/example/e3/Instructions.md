# Exercise 3: Creating Variables and Printing

## Objective
Learn how to create and use different types of variables in Java and print them on the same line.

## Instructions

1. **Create Variables**
    - Inside the `main` method, declare a boolean variable named `myBoolean` and set it to `false`:
      ```java
      boolean myBoolean = false;
      ```

2. **Create Variables**
    - Declare a double variable named `money` and set it to `99999.99`:
      ```java
      double money = 99999.99;
      ```

3. **Print Values**
    - Use `System.out.print` to print the value of the variable `money` followed by the value of the variable `myBoolean` on the same line:
      ```java
      System.out.print(money);
      System.out.print(myBoolean);
      ```

4. **Run Your Program** to see the output.

## Expected Output
```
99999.99false
```

## Tips
- Remember to use `System.out.print` instead of `System.out.println` to print on the same line.
- Ensure your variables are declared and assigned correctly.

## Additional Information
- **Boolean Variables**: A boolean variable can only have two values: `true` or `false`.
- **Double Variables**: A double variable can hold decimal numbers.
- **Printing Values**: `System.out.print` is used to print text or variables to the console on the same line.

## Troubleshooting
- If your program doesn't compile, check for syntax errors such as missing semicolons or incorrect variable declarations.
- If the output is not as expected, ensure that the variables are assigned the correct values and printed correctly.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully complete the exercise and understand how to work with boolean and double variables in Java. Happy coding!
