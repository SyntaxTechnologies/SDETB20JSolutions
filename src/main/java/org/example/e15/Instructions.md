# Exercise 15: Time Conversion

## Objective
Learn how to use the modulus operator in Java through a practical scenario involving time conversion.

## Instructions

**Time Conversion**

In this project, you will write a small program that converts a total number of minutes into hours and minutes.

**For you to do:**

1. **Create Variables**
    - Create an int variable called `totalMinutes`. Set it equal to any number representing the total minutes (e.g., 125).

2. **Calculate Hours and Minutes**
    - Use integer division to calculate the number of hours and store the result in a variable called `hours`.
    - Use the modulus operator to calculate the remaining minutes and store the result in a variable called `minutes`.

3. **Print the Results**
    - Print the number of hours and minutes in the following format:


## Expected Output
```
125 minutes is equal to 2 hours and 5 minutes.
```

## Tips
- Remember to use `System.out.println` to print the results.
- Ensure your variables are declared and assigned correctly.

## Additional Information
- **Integer Variables**: An integer variable can hold whole numbers.
- **Modulus Operator**: Use the `%` operator to calculate the remainder of a division operation.

## Troubleshooting
- If your program doesn't compile, check for syntax errors such as missing semicolons or incorrect variable declarations.
- If the output is not as expected, ensure that the variables are assigned the correct values and printed correctly.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully complete the exercise and understand how to use the modulus operator in Java. Happy coding!
