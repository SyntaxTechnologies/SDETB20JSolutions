# Exercise 19: Distance Conversion

## Objective
Learn how to use the modulus operator in Java through a practical scenario involving distance conversion.

## Instructions

**Distance Conversion**

In this project, you will write a small program that converts a total number of meters into kilometers and meters.

**For you to do:**

1. **Create Variables**
    - Create an int variable called `totalMeters`. Set it equal to any number representing the total meters (e.g., 1850).

2. **Calculate Kilometers and Meters**
    - Use integer division to calculate the number of kilometers and store the result in a variable called `kilometers`.
    - Use the modulus operator to calculate the remaining meters and store the result in a variable called `meters`.

3. **Print the Results**
    - Print the number of kilometers and meters in the following format:


## Expected Output
```
1850 meters is equal to 1 kilometers and 850 meters.
```

## Tips
- Remember to use `System.out.println` to print the results.
- Ensure your variables are declared and assigned correctly.

## Additional Information
- **Integer Variables**: An integer variable can hold whole numbers.
- **Modulus Operator**: Use the `%` operator to calculate the remainder of a division operation.

## Troubleshooting
- If your program doesn't compile, check for syntax errors such as missing semicolons or incorrect variable declarations.
- If the output is not as expected, ensure that the variables are assigned the correct values and printed correctly.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully complete the exercise and understand how to use the modulus operator in Java. Happy coding!
