# Exercise 8: Calculating Perimeter and Area of a Rectangle

## Objective
Learn how to calculate the perimeter and area of a rectangle using arithmetic operations in Java.

## Instructions

**For you to do:**

1. **Declare Variables**
    - Declare an integer variable `width` and assign a value of 5 to it.
    - Declare an integer variable `height` and assign a value of 8 to it.

2. **Calculate Perimeter**
    - Calculate the perimeter of the rectangle using the formula:
      [
      perimeter = 2 times (width + height)
      ]

3. **Calculate Area**
    - Calculate the area of the rectangle using the formula:
      [
      area = width times height
      ]

4. **Print Values**
    - Print the perimeter and area in the following format:
      ```java
      System.out.println("The perimeter of a rectangle with width " + width + " and height " + height + " is equal to " + perimeter + " and the area equals to " + area);
      ```

5. **Run Your Program** to see the output.

## Expected Output
```
The perimeter of a rectangle with width 5 and height 8 is equal to 26 and the area equals to 40
```

## Tips
- Remember to use `System.out.println` to print the result.
- Ensure your variables are declared and assigned correctly.

## Additional Information
- **Integer Variables**: An integer variable can hold whole numbers.
- **Arithmetic Operations**: Use the `+`, `*`, and other arithmetic operators to perform calculations.

## Troubleshooting
- If your program doesn't compile, check for syntax errors such as missing semicolons or incorrect variable declarations.
- If the output is not as expected, ensure that the variables are assigned the correct values and printed correctly.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully complete the exercise and understand how to calculate the perimeter and area of a rectangle in Java. Happy coding!
