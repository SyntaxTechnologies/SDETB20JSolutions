# Exercise 7: Arithmetic Operations

## Objective
Learn how to perform basic arithmetic operations in Java.

## Instructions

**For you to do:**

1. **Declare Variables**
    - Declare an integer variable `num1` and assign a value of 200 to it:

    - Declare an integer variable `num2` and assign a value of 100 to it:


2. **Perform Operations**
    - Add the num1 and num2 store the result in a variable `sum`:

    - Subtract the num2 from the num1 and store the result in a variable `difference`:

    - Multiply the num1 and num2  and store the result in a variable `product`:

    - Divide the num1 by the num2 and store the result in a variable `quotient`:


3. **Print Values**
    - Print the values of each operation result on a separate line for example for sum:
      ```java
      System.out.println(sum);
      ```

4. **Run Your Program** to see the output.

## Expected Output
```
300
100
20000
2
```

## Tips
- Remember to use `System.out.println` to print each result on a new line.
- Ensure your variables are declared and assigned correctly.

## Additional Information
- **Integer Variables**: An integer variable can hold whole numbers.
- **Arithmetic Operations**: Use the `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/` operators to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division respectively.

## Troubleshooting
- If your program doesn't compile, check for syntax errors such as missing semicolons or incorrect variable declarations.
- If the output is not as expected, ensure that the variables are assigned the correct values and printed correctly.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully complete the exercise and understand how to perform basic arithmetic operations in Java. Happy coding!
