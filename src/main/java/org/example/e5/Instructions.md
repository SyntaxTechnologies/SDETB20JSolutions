# Exercise 5: Creating Variables and Printing

## Objective
Learn how to create and use different types of variables in Java and print them.

## Instructions

**For you to do:**

1. **Create Variables**
    - Create a String variable `name` and assign a value of "Chen" to it:
      ```java
      String name = "Chen";
      ```

2. **Create Variables**
    - Create an integer variable `age` and assign a value of 50 to it:
      ```java
      int age = 50;
      ```

3. **Create Variables**
    - Create an integer variable `iq` and assign the value of `age` to it (do NOT use `= 50`):
      ```java
      int iq = age;
      ```

4. **Print Values**
    - Print the value of `name`:
      ```java
      System.out.println(name);
      ```

5. **Print Values**
    - Print the value of `age` and the value of `iq` on the same line:
      ```java
      System.out.print(age);
      System.out.print(iq);
      ```

4. **Run Your Program** to see the output.

## Expected Output
```
Chen
5050
```

## Tips
- Remember to use `System.out.println` to print `name` on a new line.
- Use `System.out.print` to print `age` and `iq` on the same line.

## Additional Information
- **String Variables**: A String variable can hold text.
- **Integer Variables**: An integer variable can hold whole numbers.
- **Printing Values**: `System.out.println` prints text or variables to the console on a new line, while `System.out.print` prints on the same line.

## Troubleshooting
- If your program doesn't compile, check for syntax errors such as missing semicolons or incorrect variable declarations.
- If the output is not as expected, ensure that the variables are assigned the correct values and printed correctly.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully complete the exercise and understand how to create and print variables in Java. Happy coding!
