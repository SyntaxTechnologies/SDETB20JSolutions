# Exercise 27: Grade Calculator (If-Else If Statements)

## Objective
Learn how to use `if-else if` statements in Java to determine letter grades based on numerical scores.

## Instructions
**Grade Calculator**
In this project, you will write a program that calculates letter grades based on numerical scores.

**For you to do:**
1. **Declare Variables**
   - Declare a variable `score` and assign an integer value between 0 and 100 to it.
2. **Calculate Grade**
   - Use `if-else if` statements to determine the letter grade based on the following scale:
      - 90-100: 'A'
      - 80-89: 'B'
      - 70-79: 'C'
      - 60-69: 'D'
      - 0-59: 'F'
   - Print the letter grade.

## Expected Output
```
Your grade is: B
```

## Tips
- Start with the highest range and work your way down using `if-else if` statements.
- Remember that each condition will be checked in order.

## Troubleshooting
- If your program doesn't compile, check for syntax errors such as missing semicolons or incorrect variable declarations.
- If the output is not as expected, verify that your conditions are correct and in the right order.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully complete the exercise and understand how to use `if-else if` statements in Java. Happy coding!
