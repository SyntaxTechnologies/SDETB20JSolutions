# Exercise 10: String Concatenation

## Objective
Learn how to create string variables and concatenate them in Java.

## Instructions

**For you to do:**

1. **Create Variables**
    - Declare a variable and assign the value "Java" to it:
      ```java
      String language = "Java";
      ```

2. **Create Variables**
    - Declare a variable and assign the value "programming language" to it:
      ```java
      String description = "programming language";
      ```

3. **Print Values**
    - Concatenate both strings and print the output so that it looks like "Java is the #1 programming language":
      ```java
      System.out.println(language + " is the #1 " + description);
      ```

4. **Run Your Program** to see the output.

## Expected Output
```
Java is the #1 programming language
```

## Tips
- Remember to use `System.out.println` to print the concatenated string on a new line.
- Ensure your variables are declared and assigned correctly.

## Additional Information
- **String Variables**: A String variable can hold text.
- **String Concatenation**: Use the `+` operator to concatenate (combine) strings.

## Troubleshooting
- If your program doesn't compile, check for syntax errors such as missing semicolons or incorrect variable declarations.
- If the output is not as expected, ensure that the variables are assigned the correct values and printed correctly.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully complete the exercise and understand how to concatenate strings in Java. Happy coding!
