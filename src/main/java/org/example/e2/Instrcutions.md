# Exercise 2: Creating Variables and Printing Them

## Objective
Learn how to create and use integer variables in Java.

## Instructions

1. **Create Variables**
   - Inside the `main` method, declare an integer variable named `age`:
     ```java
     int age;
     ```

2. **Assign Values**
   - Assign the value `4` to the variable `age`:
     ```java
     age = 4;
     ```

3. **Print Values**
   - Use `System.out.println` to print the value of the variable:
     ```java
     System.out.println(age);
     ```

4. **Run Your Program** to see the output.

## Expected Output
```
4
```

## Tips
- Remember to use `System.out.println` to print the variable on a new line.
- Ensure your integer variable is declared and assigned correctly.

## Additional Information
- **Integer Variables**: An integer variable can hold whole numbers.
- **Printing Values**: `System.out.println` is used to print text or variables to the console. Each call to `System.out.println` prints a new line.

## Troubleshooting
- If your program doesn't compile, check for syntax errors such as missing semicolons or incorrect variable declarations.
- If the output is not as expected, ensure that the variable is assigned the correct value and printed correctly.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully complete the exercise and understand how to work with integer variables in Java. Happy coding!
