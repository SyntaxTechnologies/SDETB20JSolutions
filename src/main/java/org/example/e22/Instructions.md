# Exercise 22: User Information and Age Check

## Objective
Learn how to use simple if-else conditions to make decisions based on user information.

## Instructions

**User Information and Age Check**

In this project, you will write a small program that assigns values to variables for a user's name, mobile number, and age, and then displays the information. Additionally, the program will check if the user is above a certain age.

**For you to do:**

1. **Declare Variables**
   - Declare a string variable called `name` and assign it the value `"Weqas"`.
   - Declare a string variable called `mobileNumber` and assign it the value `"123-456-7890"`.
   - Declare an integer variable called `age` and assign it the value `45`.

2. **Print User Information**
   - Print the user's information in the format: `Your name is Weqas, your age is 45, and your mobile number is 123-456-7890`.

3. **Check Age**
   - Use a simple if-else condition to check if the user is 18 or older.
   - If the user is 18 or older, print: `You are an adult.`
   - If the user is younger than 18, print: `You are not an adult.`

## Example Output
```
Your name is Weqas, your age is 45, and your mobile number is 123-456-7890
You are an adult.
```

## Tips
- Ensure your variables are declared and assigned correctly.
- Use simple if-else conditions to check the age.

## Troubleshooting
- If your program doesn't compile, check for syntax errors such as missing semicolons or incorrect variable declarations.
- If the output is not as expected, ensure that the variables are assigned the correct values and the if-else conditions are implemented correctly.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully complete the exercise and understand how to use simple if-else conditions to make decisions based on user information in Java. Happy coding!
