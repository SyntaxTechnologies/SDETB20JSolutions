# Exercise 6: Arithmetic Operations

## Objective
Learn how to perform arithmetic operations in Java.

## Instructions

**For you to do:**

1. **Create a Variable**
    - Create a float data type variable and assign a value of 8.2 to it:


2. **Perform Operation**
    - Multiply the value by itself and store the result in a new variable:


3. **Print Values**
    - Print the result in the following format:


4. **Run Your Program** to see the output.

## Expected Output
```
The multiplication of 8.2 with itself is equal to 67.24
```

## Tips
- Remember to use `System.out.println` to print the result.
- Ensure your variables are declared and assigned correctly.

## Additional Information
- **Float Variables**: A float variable can hold decimal numbers.
- **Arithmetic Operations**: Use the `*` operator to multiply numbers.

## Troubleshooting
- If your program doesn't compile, check for syntax errors such as missing semicolons or incorrect variable declarations.
- If the output is not as expected, ensure that the variables are assigned the correct values and printed correctly.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully complete the exercise and understand how to perform arithmetic operations in Java. Happy coding!
