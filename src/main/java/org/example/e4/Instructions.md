# Exercise 4: Creating Variables and Printing

## Objective
Learn how to use print statements to create patterns in Java.

## Instructions

**For you to do:**

1. **Print Pattern**
    - Use `System.out.println` to print the following pattern:
      ```java
      *
      **
      ***
      ##
      #
      ```

4. **Run Your Program** to see the output.

## Expected Output
```
*
**
***
##
#
```

## Tips
- Use `System.out.println` to print each line.
- Ensure each print statement corresponds to one line of the pattern.

## Additional Information
- **Printing Patterns**: Using print statements can help create various text patterns.

## Troubleshooting
- If your program doesn't compile, check for syntax errors such as missing semicolons or incorrect print statements.
- If the output is not as expected, ensure that the pattern matches the required output exactly.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully complete the exercise and understand how to create patterns with print statements in Java. Happy coding!
