# Exercise 21: Checking Positive or Negative Number

## Objective
Learn how to use simple if-else conditions to check if a number is positive or negative.

## Instructions

**Checking Positive or Negative Number**

In this project, you will write a small program that assigns a number to a variable, checks if it is positive or negative, and then prints the result.

**For you to do:**

1. **Declare a Variable**
   - Declare an integer variable called `number`.
   - Assign the value `-5` to `number`.

2. **Check if the Number is Positive or Negative**
   - Use a simple if-else condition to check if `number` is positive.
   - If `number` is positive, print: `The number is positive.`
   - If `number` is negative, print: `The number is negative.`

## Example Output
```
The number is negative.
```

## Tips
- Ensure your variable is declared and assigned correctly.
- Use a simple if-else condition to check if the number is greater than 0.

## Troubleshooting
- If your program doesn't compile, check for syntax errors such as missing semicolons or incorrect variable declarations.
- If the output is not as expected, ensure that the condition and print statements are implemented correctly.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully complete the exercise and understand how to use simple if-else conditions to check if a number is positive or negative in Java. Happy coding!
