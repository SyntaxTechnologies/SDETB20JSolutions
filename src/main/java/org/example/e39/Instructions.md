# Exercise 39: Grading System

## Objective
Learn how to use the `Scanner` class in Java to capture numerical input from the user and use conditional statements to determine the corresponding grade based on the marks.

## Instructions

**Grading System**

In this project, you will write a small program that asks the user for their marks and then determines the corresponding grade based on the school's grading system.

**For you to do:**

1. **Create a Scanner Object**
    - Create a `Scanner` object to read input from the console.

2. **Capture Marks Input**
    - Print "Please enter your mark".
    - Capture the user's input for the marks and store it in a variable called `marks`.

3. **Determine the Grade**
    - Use conditional statements to determine the grade based on the marks:
        - If marks are between 1 and 25 (inclusive), set `grade` to "F".
        - If marks are between 26 and 45 (inclusive), set `grade` to "E".
        - If marks are between 46 and 50 (inclusive), set `grade` to "D".
        - If marks are between 51 and 60 (inclusive), set `grade` to "C".
        - If marks are between 61 and 80 (inclusive), set `grade` to "B".
        - If marks are above 80, set `grade` to "A".
        - If marks are not within the valid range (0-100), print "Please enter valid mark".

4. **Print the Grade**
    - Print "Your grade is ____" with the corresponding grade.

## Expected Output
```
Please enter your mark
85
Your grade is A
```

```
Please enter your mark
-5
Please enter valid mark
```

## Tips
- Remember to import the `Scanner` class using `import java.util.Scanner;`.
- Ensure your variables are declared and assigned correctly.
- Use conditional statements to determine the grade based on the marks.

## Additional Information
- **Scanner Class**: The `Scanner` class is used to get user input. It is found in the `java.util` package.
- **Conditional Statements**: Use conditional statements to make decisions based on multiple conditions.

## Troubleshooting
- If your program doesn't compile, check for syntax errors such as missing semicolons or incorrect variable declarations.
- If the output is not as expected, ensure that the input is captured and printed correctly.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully complete the exercise and understand how to use the `Scanner` class and conditional statements in Java. Happy coding!
