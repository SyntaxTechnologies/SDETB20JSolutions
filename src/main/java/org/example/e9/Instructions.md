# Exercise 9: String Concatenation

## Objective
Learn how to create string variables and concatenate them in Java.

## Instructions

**For you to do:**

1. **Create Variables**
    - Create a variable and assign the value "John" to it:
      ```java
      String firstName = "John";
      ```

2. **Create Variables**
    - Create a variable and assign the value "Smith" to it:
      ```java
      String lastName = "Smith";
      ```

3. **Print Values**
    - Print the concatenated value of the variables `firstName` and `lastName` with a space in between:
      ```java
      System.out.println(firstName + " " + lastName);
      ```

4. **Run Your Program** to see the output.

## Expected Output
```
John Smith
```

## Tips
- Remember to use `System.out.println` to print the concatenated string on a new line.
- Ensure your variables are declared and assigned correctly.

## Additional Information
- **String Variables**: A String variable can hold text.
- **String Concatenation**: Use the `+` operator to concatenate (combine) strings.

## Troubleshooting
- If your program doesn't compile, check for syntax errors such as missing semicolons or incorrect variable declarations.
- If the output is not as expected, ensure that the variables are assigned the correct values and printed correctly.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully complete the exercise and understand how to concatenate strings in Java. Happy coding!
