# Exercise 1: Creating Variables and Printing Them

## Objective
Learn how to create and use boolean variables in Java.

## Instructions

1. **Create Variables**
    - Inside the `main` method, declare two boolean variables named `isTrue` and `isFalse`:
      ```java
      boolean isTrue;
      boolean isFalse;
      ```

2. **Assign Values**
    - Assign the value `true` to the variable `isTrue`:
      ```java
      isTrue = true;
      ```
    - Assign the value `false` to the variable `isFalse`:
      ```java
      isFalse = false;
      ```

3. **Print Values**
    - Use `System.out.println` to print the value of each variable:
      ```java
      System.out.println(isTrue);
      System.out.println(isFalse);
      ```

4. **Run Your Program** to see the output.

## Expected Output
```
true
false
```

## Tips
- Remember to use `System.out.println` to print each variable on a new line.
- Ensure your boolean variables are declared and assigned correctly.

## Additional Information
- **Boolean Variables**: A boolean variable can only have two values: `true` or `false`. These are useful for representing binary states.
- **Printing Values**: `System.out.println` is used to print text or variables to the console. Each call to `System.out.println` prints a new line.

## Troubleshooting
- If your program doesn't compile, check for syntax errors such as missing semicolons or incorrect variable declarations.
- If the output is not as expected, ensure that the variables are assigned the correct values and printed in the right order.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully complete the exercise and understand how to work with boolean variables in Java. Happy coding!
