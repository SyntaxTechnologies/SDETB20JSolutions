# Exercise 23: Checking if a String Equals "Java"

## Objective
Learn how to use simple if-else conditions to check if a string equals a specific value.

## Instructions

**Checking if a String Equals "Java"**

In this project, you will write a small program that assigns a string to a variable, checks if it equals "Java", and then prints the result.

**For you to do:**

1. **Declare a Variable**
   - Declare a string variable called `language`.
   - Assign the value `"Java"` to `language`.

2. **Check if the String Equals "Java"**
   - Use a simple if-else condition to check if `language` equals `"Java"`.
   - If `language` equals `"Java"`, print: `The programming language is Java.`
   - If `language` does not equal `"Java"`, print: `The programming language is not Java.`

## Example Output
```
The programming language is Java.
```

## Tips
- Ensure your variable is declared and assigned correctly.
- Use the `equals` method of the `String` class to compare strings.

## Troubleshooting
- If your program doesn't compile, check for syntax errors such as missing semicolons or incorrect variable declarations.
- If the output is not as expected, ensure that the condition and print statements are implemented correctly.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully complete the exercise and understand how to use simple if-else conditions to check if a string equals a specific value in Java. Happy coding!
